# React-Tutorial

### Quick Start 
https://reactjs.org/docs/installation.html#creating-a-new-application



Whenever `this.setState` is called, an update to the component is scheduled, causing React to merge in the passed state update and rerender the component along with its descendants.

`functional components` Rather than define a class extending React.Component, simply write a function that takes props and returns what should be rendered.


### Note
- JS use 2 spaces instead of tab
- It is, however, conventional in React apps to use on* names for the attributes and handle* for the handler methods.
